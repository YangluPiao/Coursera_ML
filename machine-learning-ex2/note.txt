1. DONOT regularize theta_0 in regularized logistic regression.
2. One way to fit the data better is to create more features from each data
point. In the provided function mapFeature.m, we will map the features into
all polynomial terms of x1 and x2 up to the sixth power.
3. small lambda -> may overfit;large lambda  -> may underfit.
